        How Our Model Works:<br><br>
    </h2>
        <h3>
            Our model streamlines legal research and prediction by automating the analysis and summarization of complex legal data.
            Here's how it works step-by-step:<br><br>
            
            User Authentication: Users (e.g., legal professionals) securely log in to access our platform.<br><br>
            
            Data Collection: Once authenticated, the system collects legal data from commercial courts.<br><br>
            
            Natural Language Processing (NLP): The collected legal data undergoes various NLP techniques to extract valuable
            insights:<br><br>
            
            Data Preprocessing (spaCy): Text is cleaned and preprocessed for further analysis.<br><br>
            Feature Extraction (Gensim): Specific features are extracted from the data to represent important aspects.<br><br>
            Legal-Specific Abstraction (Transformers): Advanced models abstract relevant legal details to make sense of large
            volumes of text.<br><br>
            Evaluation (ROUGE): Custom algorithms assess the quality of legal data and summarizations.<br><br>
            Predictive ML Model: Using TF-IDF and scikit-learn, the system builds a predictive model based on historical legal data.
            This model is designed to predict outcomes or provide legal insights for cases, helping users anticipate decisions or
            trends. The data is stored in MongoDB for easy access and scalability.<br><br>
            
            Explainability Tool (LIME): To enhance transparency, we use LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations),
            which helps users understand how the predictions are made. This ensures that the model is interpretable and that users
            can trust the outcomes.<br><br>
            
            Predictive & Summarized Results: The results are then delivered in two forms:<br><br>
            
            Predictive Results: Offers insights and potential outcomes based on the models predictions.<br><br>
            Summarized Results: Condenses the key points of legal documents for easier understanding.<br><br>
            User Interface (UI): All of this is integrated into an easy-to-use interface, where users can view predictions,
            summaries, and explanations in a clear, intuitive manner.
