## Key Features
- **Automated Document Analysis:** Quickly analyze and summarize legal documents and court judgments.
- **Relevant Case Law Retrieval:** Enable legal professionals to efficiently retrieve pertinent case laws.
- **Predictive Insights:** Generate predictive insights based on historical data from past cases.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A simple and intuitive user interface for legal professionals.

## Current Progress
- **Frontend:** The frontend is complete and functional.
- **NLP and ML Model Development:** Ongoing work is focused on training and evaluation of the NLP and machine learning models to ensure accurate document analysis and insights.
- **Backend and Business Logic:** Development is in progress, ensuring smooth integration with the frontend and efficient processing of legal data.
